Super Metroid Location Tracker by Alli_Cat

Locations are named based on what I know them to be called, names
from the wiki, or simple descriptions that are unique enough.  Markers
with a "(2)" indicate there are 2 items there.  Items with a solid white outline 
are not reachable with the current items selected. 
(Logic may need tweaking, currently in its first form)

The labels at the top ("Cratera + WS" or "Norfair") are color 
coded to the way they appear on the Full Map.  Each lettered
connection point is also color coded.  Each map has lettered 
connection points, which also function as buttons to change the 
map to their counter-part.

If you have any specific accessibility needs that I can implement
then feel free to send me some feedback.
