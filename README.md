Super Metroid Location Tracker by Alli_Cat

This tracker is flash based.  I simply don't have the knowledge 
to make it in html and java.  It does require flash to be installed.
I understand that some people may be less inclined to trust flash and
I will provide the .fla work file on request to anyone.  I have 
included a copy of the scripts I use to make this work as well.

Locations are named based on what I know them to be called, names
from the wiki, or simple descriptions that are unique enough.  Markers
with a "(2)" indicate there are 2 items there.  

The labels at the top ("Cratera + WS" or "Norfair") are color 
coded to the way they appear on the Full Map.  Each lettered
connection point is also color coded.  Each map has lettered 
connection points, which also function as buttons to change the 
map to their counter-part.

If you have any specific accessibility needs that I can implement
then feel free to send me some feedback.
